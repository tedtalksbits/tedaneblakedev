# This Is My Personal Single Page App
**Built with**:
- React
- JS
- Css - Styled-Components

## Motivation:
I will be using this app to showcase my progression as a developer.

## About Me:
My intro to programming was in 2017 as Liberal arts student. I learner about visual basic and, as a class project we built a stop light using _if statements_. **I was hooked**. However, I wasn't allowed to take more computer science or IT classes because of my major. So next year I changed my major to Information Technology! Two years later (2020), I graduated with an A.S. Applied Science (Magna Cum Laude).

In 2021 I enrolled in Farmingdale State College's Computer Programming and Info. Systems Program to earn my Bachelor of Science. I am anticipating graduating May 2023.
